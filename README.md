# Handset Price Prediction and Feature Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting handset prices based on various features such as RAM, battery capacity, camera quality, processor type, and more. The project explores feature importance and provides actionable insights to improve pricing and marketing strategies.

The goal of this project is to:
1. Build a predictive model for estimating handset prices.
2. Identify the most significant features influencing handset pricing.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, preprocessing, feature analysis, and modeling steps.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `visualizations/`: Graphs and charts showcasing the results, such as feature importance and model performance.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages needed to run the code.

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization of features.
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature selection techniques (RFE, Lasso Regression).
- Model building with multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Model evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².
- Feature importance analysis for pricing insights.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhisharudra/My Project 4.git
   cd handset-price-prediction
